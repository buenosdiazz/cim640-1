# CIM640
## Hi! I'm Melissa Gutierrez
### Until a year ago, I was living in New York for six years. I got my BFA in Photography from Parsons The New School for Design. I really miss street cart coffee and lox bagels. I hope to pursue Interaction Design, though I have a lot of learning to do before then. I'm excited to be here!
