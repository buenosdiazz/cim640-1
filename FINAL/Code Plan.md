My final project will include three scenarios: one positive, one standard, and one ultimately, one that will seriously injure the passenger. The project will take place in a subway station, and the there will be a function that will allow the viewer to open and close the door. The keyboard will be the tool utilized for the opening and the closing of the door. There will be images attached to variable to include the different scenarios. I will be running a loop for the randomization of situations. I believe utilizing the sound library on p5js will add the perfect element of illustrating the subway experience.
