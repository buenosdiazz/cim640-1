For my final project, I’ve been considering three ideas. The first would be three doors that would lead you to three different subway scenarios. The first door would lead to a scenario where the subway is running express and not stopping. The second door’s scenario would be the subway stalled and not moving. The third door’s scenario would be the user’s dream: the train arriving just as they get to the platform. Another idea I had was creating building blocks where the user can construct a building of their choice. Lastly, I thought about creating a photo studio with animals where you could place different props on them.
